## About the base project
This is the application you are going to use through the whole traninig. This, hopefully, will teach you the fundamentals you need in a real project. You will find a basic TODO application designed with a [microservice architecture](https://microservices.io). Although is a TODO application, it is interesting because the microservices that compose it are written in different programming language or frameworks (Go, Python, Vue, Java, and NodeJS). With this design you will experiment with multiple build tools and environments.
